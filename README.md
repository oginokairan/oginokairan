### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building apps or frameworks mainly using NodeJs(TypeScript) and [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless).

Since I was working as a server and database engineer until a few years ago, primarily focusing on on-premises servers and virtual machines on cloud operation systems. Now I realize the fact that serverless functions - Function as a Service - and ecosystem around them make my life a lot more easier.
